1) we can implement common interface like DS which contains method getData and getData give iterable list of integer
2) thn on client end we had responsibility to iterate each value one by one.
3) So here drawback is client had maintain proper responsibility to iterate each member one by one tracking like index reached it size or not which is not ideal case scenario
